Before trying IVF, you can take steps to improve fertility naturally. Eat healthy food with iron, zinc, folic acid. Avoid junk, alcohol and smoking. Exercise daily but not too much.

For women, check thyroid and hormones. For men, take care of sperm health â€“ avoid hot baths, tight underwear and stress.

Yoga and meditation also help reduce stress, which affects fertility. Some couples try Ayurveda, but always talk to doctor before mixing treatment.
